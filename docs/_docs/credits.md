If you use `osim-rl` in your research, you can cite it as follows:

    @incollection{kidzinski2018learningtorun,
      author      = "Kidzi\'nski, {\L}ukasz and Mohanty, Sharada P and Ong, Carmichael and Hicks, Jennifer and Francis, Sean and Levine, Sergey and Salath\'e, Marcel and Delp, Scott",
      title       = "Learning to Run challenge: Synthesizing physiologically accurate motion using deep reinforcement learning",
      editor      = "Escalera, Sergio and Weimer, Markus",
      booktitle   = "NIPS 2017 Competition Book",
      publisher   = "Springer",
      address     = "Springer",
      year        = 2018
    }

If you use the top solutions or other solution reports from the Learning to Run challenge, you can cite them as:
