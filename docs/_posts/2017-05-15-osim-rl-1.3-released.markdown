Due to the errors described in [issue #31](https://github.com/stanfordnmbl/osim-rl/issues/31) we updated the environment
introducing the following changes:

* added velocities of joints (previously we had a duplicate of positions of joints)
* added the left psoas in `muscles` (previously there was only right psoas twice)
* moved obstacles closer to the starting point (so that it's easier to train on them)
* extended the trials to 1000 iterations (if they don't trip/fall earlier as it was before)

In order to switch to the new environment you need to update the `osim-rl` scripts with the following command:

    pip install git+https://github.com/stanfordnmbl/osim-rl.git -U


Since the observation vector changed, you may need to retrain your existing model to account for these new changes.
However, the old observation is in fact a subset of the new observation so if you want to submit the old model
```python
for j in range(6,12):
    observation[j+6] = observation[j]
observation[36] = observation[37]
observation, reward, done, info = env.step(my_controller(observation))
```
Yet, with new information, your controller should be able to perform betters, so we definitely advise to retrain model.
